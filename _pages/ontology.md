## Introduction


<p>The volunteering and social action ontology can be <a href="/webvowl/#opts=doc=0;filter_sco=true;mode_compact=true">visualized through WebVOWL</a>, a web-based ontology visualization tool.</p>

<p>The volunteering and social action ontology is implemented using RDF, a native data format for the semantic web. RDF enables the <a href="https://5stardata.info/en/">5-star</a> deployment scheme for Open Data; a scheme suggested by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web and <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">Linked Data</a> initiator.</p>


## Volunteering Data Model

<p>The following diagram illustrates the main elements of the Volunteering and Social Action Ontology.</p>

        "address": "127-128 Lower Marsh, London SE1 7AE, UK",
        "latitude": "51.5005014",

</div>

<div class="note">
  <h5 id="note-2">Note 2</h5>
  <p>In example 2, the organisation is referred to through its identifier. It is also possible to embed the organisation details in the activity representation.</p>
  <p>Standard-defined <a href="#time-defined-temporal-entities">temporal entities</a> can be referred to via their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE">compact URI</a> (using the "volunteering" prefix). That is: "volunteering:TuesdayMorning" is equivalent to "https://ns.volunteeringdata.io/TuesdayMorning".</p>
  <p>New temporal entities can be defined using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">Time ontology in OWL</a>. See for example <a href="https://api.volunteeringdata.io/describe.ttl?id=https://ns.volunteeringdata.io/TuesdayMorning">Tuesday Morning</a>.</p>
  <p>While URLs are preferable for identifiers because the data is then authoritative and can be <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkedData">dereferenced</a> at source, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt">urn:uuid:</a> identifiers can be used too.</p>

#### Example

<div class="example">
  <h5 id="example-5">Example 5</h5>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "@context": "https://api.volunteeringdata.io/context/v1",
  "type": "Location",

}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="note">
  <h5 id="note-4">Note 4</h5>
  <p>Locations could be predefined and reused. For example, a council's boundary can be serialised as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry">Well-Known Text (WKT)</a> and linked to via the <code>geometry</code> property. The <a href="https://docs.ogc.org/is/22-047r1/22-047r1.html">GeoSPARQL standard</a> defines how to link geometries to <a href="https://docs.ogc.org/is/22-047r1/22-047r1.html#C.1.1.2.2">WKT literals</a>. For an example of such a boundary, see the <a href="https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/2508.html">geometry of the Hackney Borough Council</a>.</p>
